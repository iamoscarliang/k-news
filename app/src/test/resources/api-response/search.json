      "title": "Officers&#8217; Body Cam Footage Shows Calm Exchange with Parolee Before Encounter Turns Deadly",
      "text": "Authorities on Thursday released video footage of two officers’ fatal shooting of a parolee who opened fire on them when they tried to arrest him last fall in Escondido. The events that led to the deadly shootout began shortly after 6:30 a.m. Nov. 3, when a resident of the Eastwood Meadows Mobile Home park on East Valley Parkway reported that a stranger in a sleeping bag was on her porch, Escondido police said. Following a brief argument with the woman, the trespasser, later identified as Douglas Quinn, 48, of Indiana, walked over to a nearby parked motorcycle and began pushing it through the complex. Escondido Officers Anthony Lay and Michael Statti arrived a short time later. With their uniform-worn cameras activated, they made contact with Quinn, standing beside the motorcycle. The man told them he had gone to the park in search of a friend. “If you wouldn’t mind just keeping your hands where we can see them, you know, we’re weird about things like that,” Statti warned Quinn as he fussed over the seat of his motorcycle. In response to questions from a chatty Statti, Quinn said he had ridden his motorcycle from the Midwest to the San Diego region in search of work. He also said he had spent about 20 years in prison and admitted that he was the subject of a parole-violation warrant issued in his home state. Minutes later, when Statti told Quinn the officers were “just gonna, you know, place you in cuffs,” the suspect mumbled and began to bolt to the right, while reaching behind him. “Don’t you touch it,” the officer, who had been congenial, warned him. But Quinn immediately pulled a handgun from his waistband and pointed it across his body at the officers, firing several rounds while running away. Lay and Statti returned fire, and Quinn collapsed into a hedge alongside a perimeter wall. While on the ground, Quinn turned toward the officers, still holding the gun, prompting one of the officers to fire more shots. After backup officers arrived, police sent a service dog to check on Quinn. When he remained motionless, the personnel moved in and performed CPR, to no avail. Paramedics then took him to a hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. – Staff and wire reports Note: Photo credit – Douglas Quinn reaches behind him in the moment before his encounter with Escondido officers turns deadly.

      "text": "WhatsApp Facebook Twitter File photo The Member of Parliament for the North Tongu Constituency, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa has lamented the current state of Ghana’s top tier football league, the Ghana Premier League. He believes the Ghana Premier League is a dead product at the moment because it doesn’t get the investment it deserves. Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa is saying this following the confirmation that the Ministry of Youth and Sports intended to spend 8.5 million dollars at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations. Speaking on the floor of parliament, Ablakwa said there is too much focus on the Black Stars to the neglect of other important aspects of football in the country. \"Mr Speaker, the document the Sports Ministry submitted to this house, if you look at what we spent on qualifiers, Ghana v Angola home and away amounted to Ghc7.4m and Ghana v Madagascar also amounted to Ghc13.2m. The airlifting of supporters from Ghana to Qatar was GHC5.3 million. We are throwing hundreds of millions into supporting this Black Stars and we are still not getting results. \"Look at the state of our pitches. We don't even have a single FIFA standard pitch. Youth development is gone. The local league is gone,\" he added.",

      "text": "WhatsApp Facebook Twitter Alidu Seidu made an appearance for Rennes in their tough 3-0 loss to AC Milan Ghanaian defender Alidu Seidu made an appearance for Rennes in their tough 3-0 loss to AC Milan during the UEFA Europa League knockout play-off round on Thursday night. Entering the match as a substitute in the 67th minute for Guela Doue, the 23-year-old couldn’t sway the game’s momentum in Rennes’ favor, as AC Milan secured a commanding victory. AC Milan’s Ruben Loftus-Cheek was the standout performer, netting two goals in the 32nd and 48th minutes, with Rafael Leao adding another goal in the 53rd minute, further solidifying Milan’s lead and leaving Rennes facing an uphill battle. The result leaves Rennes in a challenging position, requiring a significant turnaround in the second leg scheduled for February 22 in France. Prior to their Europa League rematch, Rennes will shift their focus to domestic competition, as they prepare to host Alidu Seidu’s former club Clermont Foot in a Ligue 1 clash on Sunday, February 18. This upcoming match could present an opportunity for Seidu to earn his first league start and showcase his skills on the domestic stage. Since his transfer from Clermont Foot during the January window, Seidu has already made four appearances across all competitions for Rennes.",

      "text": "There's no disputing that MrBeast makes a lot of money. The YouTuber — real name Jimmy Donaldson — rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars from his YouTube channel and Feastables food brand. But despite bringing in revenue between $600 million and $700 million each year, Donaldson says he's not rich. His massive channel has 239 million subscribers, and his videos regularly get well over 100 million views. \"Each video does a couple million in ad revenue, a couple million in brand deals,\" he told Time Magazine this week, which noted that brands pay between $2.5 million to $3 million for a shout-out in a video. But that money doesn't go into his bank account. And even if it did, the 25-year-old said he doesn't have access to it. \"I don't have access to any of my bank accounts,\" he said. \"I have a CFO and everything, but [my mom is] the one who has access to the master bank account.\" Instead, the income goes back into growing his brand and audience. \"I've reinvested everything to the point of—you could claim—stupidity, just believing that we would succeed,\" he said. \"And it's worked out.\" Part of the investment involves sparing no expense on his massive, popular stunts such as buying a grocery store and paying a contestant $10,000 each day he is able to live in it. A shoot that captures 12,000 hours of footage may end up as a video that is just 15 minutes long, Time reports. Of course, Donaldson isn't exactly scraping by. The creator has a personal chef and a trainer, according to Time, and he lives in a 3,000 square-foot-home that he purchased for $320,000 in 2018, according to the New York Post. With plans to continue growing his empire, Donaldson admits that he may eventually reap the financial rewards. \"I'm not naïve; maybe one day,\" he said of being rich. \"But right now, whatever we make, we reinvest.\" Want to land your dream job in 2024?

      "title": "The Food Guy: Hagen's Fish Market busier than ever during Lent",
      "text": "With Fat Tuesday and Ash Wednesday behind us, the season of Lent is underway. Catholics traditionally abstain from meat on Fridays until Easter, and that means more demand for seafood. Our Food Guy visited a seafood specialist in Portage Park this week, approaching 80 years in business. Back in 1946, a couple of Scandinavian immigrants moved to the Northwest Side from Door County, Wisconsin. They brought with them an expertise in sourcing, smoking and frying fish. The business is still in the same family, now on its fourth generation. Don’t call the fire department, it’s just another day at the city’s oldest operating fish smokehouse. Hagen’s has been a fixture in Portage Park since it opened its doors in 1946. “My great grandpa and his wife, and his brother and his wife; and they both came down from Door County,” said Eric Johnson, the 4th generation owner at Hagen’s. “We smoke we fry and we’ve also got a fresh department.” Lots of fresh seafood salads too, but it’s the smoking and frying that tend to take up most of the menu. The smoker is Old School; no shortcuts here. “Instead of just using pellets or sawdust – essentially just a cinder block room in the back with a big metal box I build a fire in, and hand the fish up over it. We’ve got salmon, whitefish, mackerel that go in a couple times every week,” he said. Plus sturgeon and salmon steaks. Salmon fillets are seasoned a couple of ways – barbecued, garlic-pepper and candied. “We brine it overnight in brown sugar, maple syrup and saltwater; we’ll take it out of the fire then glaze it with the honey,” said Johnson. The fried fish is also plentiful. A sandwich or a shrimp po’boy, but mostly just fried and served in a simple paper boat. Two of the most popular: plump shrimp and Alaskan haddock. The process is mechanized, but still quite simple. Haddock for instance is submerged fully into the seasoned batter; it then emerges and is covered in fine breading, the excess shaken off, then dropped into a bucket, where it’s transferred to the fryers and cooked until crisp and golden brown. Johnson says beginning this week, the fryers are working overtime. “Lent is one of the busiest seasons of the year for us, aside from Christmas/Holiday Season. Every Friday, this whole store is packed full of people looking to get fried fish,” he said. Like pizza, fried fish is best warm, so either be prepared to heat them up at home or better yet, eat them in the car. On the other hand, smoked fish – especially the candied salmon – is great anytime. Here's where you can go: 5635 W. Montrose Ave. 773-283-1944",

      "title": "Kim Jong Un has broken with decades of North Korean policy – does it mean he’s planning for war?",
      "text": "As war in Ukraine grinds toward its third year and fighting in Gaza inflames a broader crisis across the Middle East, global security observers are keeping a close watch on another part of the world – North Korea, where Kim Jong Un’s latest provocations are raising questions about his military intentions. In recent weeks, the leader has brushed aside decades of his country’s policy toward South Korea – now proclaiming that North Korea would no longer seek reconciliation and reunification with the South and calling for it to be classified as their “permanent enemy.” North Korea “does not want war, but will not avoid it,” Kim declared at a political gathering last month, according to state outlet KCNA. If war came, the country’s goal would be “occupying, suppressing and reclaiming the Republic of Korea and subjugating it into the territory of the republic,” he said, referring to South Korea by its official name. The sweeping policy shift in the nuclear-capable country has come alongside a volley of weapons tests, the shelling of a maritime buffer zone, and calls from Kim for North Korea to accelerate war preparations in response to “confrontation moves” by the US. Together the developments are drawing international concern – and debate among seasoned observers – about the intentions of the leader at the heart of the country’s secretive regime. “We do not know when or how Kim plans to pull the trigger, but the danger is already far beyond the routine warnings in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo about Pyongyang’s ‘provocations,’” prominent experts Robert Carlin and Siegfred Heckler wrote in North Korea-focused publication 38 North last month. Kim, they suggest, has “made a strategic decision to go to war.” Many other observers disagree – arguing that the 40-year-old leader knows well that any major military move against South Korea and its ally the United States could hasten the demise of his own regime. But those observers too are bracing for a year of ramped up aggression – and express concern about the risk of North Korea’s escalated hostilities leading to some kind of military engagement on the Korean Peninsula, raising the risk, however remote, of nuclear conflict. “The situation on the Korean Peninsula has entered a very critical phase,” said Eul-Chul Lim, director of the North Korea Research Center at Kyungnam University’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Changwon. “Given the high level of mutual tension, there is a possibility of accidental conflict due to misunderstandings, misjudgments, and misperceptions” – even if Kim likely sees “little political or economic benefit” in war, he added. Kim is known for his provocations and has signaled in recent years a coming policy shift on South Korea. But experts say the changes now are likely driven by Kim’s mounting concerns as South Korea and the United States ramp up military drills and coordination – and his newfound confidence in a shifting geopolitical climate that has drawn Pyongyang closer to a key partner, Russia. The changes also coincide with an election year in the US, where President Joe Biden seeks a second term while managing multiple global crises. Kim is likely watching carefully – and may be keen to see him replaced by predecessor and candidate Donald Trump. A major shift For decades, governments on both sides of the divided Korean Peninsula have maintained they were members of the same family with the ultimate goal of peacefully reunifying. The two sides have been cut off from each other since 1953, when an armistice ended the Korean War, and remain technically at war. “(Kim Jong Un) is now saying that South Korea is no longer viewed as another Korea. South Korea is viewed as a completely foreign power,” said Edward Howell, a lecturer in politics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who focuses on the Korean Peninsula. Reclassifying South Korea as an enemy state, experts say, allows Kim to justify the continued build-up of his nuclear and missile arsenal – and hold it over Seoul, which has adopted a harder line against Pyongyang under President Yoon Suk Yeol. Despite heavy international sanctions, Kim has continued to build that arsenal in recent years, focused on developing weapons able to strike not just South Korea and Japan but the US territory of Guam and the American mainland – capabilities he sees as essential to deterring a potential attack and ensuring the survival of his regime. Since 2022 Kim has reiterated that the principle point of his nuclear arsenal is “to deter war,” but also raised the potential for nuclear weapons to be used to counter efforts to violate the North’s “fundamental interests.” He’s also become increasingly alarmed by strengthened ties between the US and South Korea. Yoon and Biden have sharpened their countries’ deterrence plans and coordination in the face of North Korea’s threats and weapons development. That’s included expanding joint drills in the region and security cooperation, including with Japan – all of which Kim sees as a threat to his regime. The “progress” by South Korea and the United States on deterrence “is one of the major reasons that Kim Jong Un feels very frustrated,” according to Won Gon Park, a professor in the department of North Korean studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. Kim has been explicit about these concerns. Last month he said that “instability of the regional situation is soaring due to the US-led escalation of military tensions,” and that while Pyongyang doesn’t want war the “danger” of its outbreak “has considerably aggravated,” according to KCNA. Kim’s policy shift on South Korea may also be linked to a view that negotiations with the US are no longer a viable path to meet goals of being recognized as a nuclear state and receiving sanctions relief. Pyongyang has rebuffed outreach from Washington in the wake of a failed 2019 summit between Kim and then-US President Trump, according to the US. The North Korean leader may also see scrapping a policy of reunification not as a step toward war but a necessary defense, some say. Kim has indicated as much in his own public statements, saying last month the country is cultivating its “strength” not for a “preemptive attack” to realize reunification by force, but instead for “legitimate self-defense.” Kim is “particularly wary of (North Korea’s) absorption by the South (and) believes that it is impossible to establish normal relations with the South without developing the North Korean economy,” according to Lim in Changwon, pointing to the country’s economic weakness relative to the South. Instead of “empty reunification talk,” Kim wants to focus resources on building his arsenal and economy – and working with new partners for economic benefit, he added. Five US officials also recently told CNN the US has seen no signs Kim is preparing for a potential attack on South Korea, or a broader provocation involving nuclear weapons. If anything, some analysts believe, North Korea’s public statements signal that North Korea is abandoning its reunification policy in pursuit of peace on the peninsula. Kim’s “No. 1 priority is the sustainment of his regime,” a senior defense official said. “That’s not a shift — that’s been a strategic priority of his entire family since the Korean War.” An ‘emboldened’ Kim The North Korean leader may also feel more confident about his arsenal and his options as he watches a shifting global landscape. From his view, experts say, Kim sees a US whose waning influence is being tested in conflicts from Ukraine to the Middle East – and an ascendant China surrounded by a burgeoning coalition of countries, including Russia and Iran, all at odds with the West. “Kim Jong Un has been emboldened … not simply by the divide between the US and China and the US and Russia, but more importantly, a fragmented world where US leadership has been weakened considerably and there are no meaningful consequences for aggression,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a nonresident fellow with the 38 North Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington. His policy shift on South Korea is part of a “broader, fundamental shift in foreign policy, namely giving up normalization of relations with the US through denuclearization and pivoting to China and Russia,” she said. That pivot got a major boost in September, when Vladimir Putin welcomed the North Korean leader to Russia for a rare overseas trip – a meeting Western officials say was fueled by the Russian President’s need to bolster dwindling munitions in his war on Ukraine. Russia has since fired North Korean-supplied short-range ballistic missiles in its war, according to the White House, which called it a “concerning escalation” of Pyongyang’s support. Analysts have speculated that Russia has reciprocated with aid for North Korea’s spy satellite program. More cooperation with Moscow could also potentially help Kim address chronic food and fuel shortages and build North Korea’s economy. China, by far North Korea’s most important economic lifeline, remains wary of any moves from Pyongyang that could destabilize or draw more US forces to the region. However, amid rising friction with Washington, Beijing has in recent years blocked US-backed efforts in the United Nations Security Council to censure North Korea, and will look to stay engaged with Pyongyang, especially as it draws closer to Moscow. Kim’s regime may also see the expanding conflict in the Middle East as an opportunity to criticize the West and garner income, according to Howell at Oxford, pointing to how Iran has long played the role of middleman for North Korea to supply weapons to militant groups like Hamas. “(One) thing that’s changed is North Korea’s ability to exploit the broader global crises to its advantage,” he said. What’s next? Experts warn that North Korea’s ratcheting up of tensions is likely to continue this year, as Washington continues to boost drills and collaboration with its regional partners to deter Kim. How to dial down those tensions is open to debate, with some policy experts stressing that this show of strength remains the best deterrence for North Korean aggression. Others argue that the coalition needs to find ways to minimize the potential for Kim to feel his regime is threatened by their activities – and prevent Pyongyang from drawing closer to Moscow and Beijing as a result. “Kim Jong Un is wary of a full-scale provocation by the South Korean military disguised as a military exercise and has vowed to occupy South Korean territory without hesitation,” said Lim in Changwon. “Therefore, if the US, South Korea, and Japan fail to de-escalate the threat from North Korea during joint military exercises, a military conflict could occur on the Korean Peninsula,” he said. Lee in Washington agreed “an emboldened Kim Jong Un may be more inclined to take military action against what he perceives to be the slightest threat to North Korea, such as joint US-South Korea military exercises.” In the months ahead, Kim will also be closely watching the upcoming US presidential elections as Trump seeks to win back office. It’s unclear whether Kim would engage with the former president again were he to be reelected. But experts say Kim is likely hopeful that a newly elected Trump, who has long been dismissive of overseas alliances, would roll back America’s security cooperation with South Korea and Japan – and the North Korean leader could even seek to impact election dynamics with an aggressive move. One potential could be for Kim to launch Pyongyang’s seventh nuclear test, in what would be the first since 2017, according to Park in Seoul. “If North Korea conducts a seventh nuclear test it means a total failure of the Biden administration and gives a very good attack point for Trump (to call Biden) ineffective in dealing with the North Korean leader,” he said. Further ahead, despite the sweeping changes Kim has now made to his country’s policy toward South Korea, if the North Korean leader sees an opening to advance his larger goals by sitting back down with the South and the US, he could change tack “anytime” – to reverse these changes, Park added. “This is the kind of behavior (one can expect from) North Korea,” he said.

      "text": "BATON ROUGE, La. — A Louisiana State University football player was arrested Thursday and charged with attempted second-degree murder after a shooting last week that injured two people. Treyvion Antwan Holly, a freshman running back, faces three charges - attempted second-degree murder, aggravated criminal damage to property and illegal use of a weapon on a public roadway, the Union Parish Sheriff said in a press release Thursday evening. Holly, 19, was booked at the Union Parish Detention Center, where he was held on a $512,000 bond. The arrest stems from a shooting on Feb. 9. in Farmerville, a town in northern Louisiana.

It’s cool to be in the same realm as a lot of really, really good players,” Clark said at halftime in a televised interview. “I’m lucky to do it because I have really good teammates and really good coaches and a great support system that surrounds me.” Iowa won the tip and Clark, guarded by Laila Phelia, drove to the basket and banked in a shot from the right side. Clark hit a 3 from the left wing on Iowa’s next possession. The Hawkeyes turned the ball over twice before Clark took a pass from Gabbie Marshall in transition, stopped and and shot from deep on the left side. When the ball went through, the fans — many of them standing and holding up phones to capture the moment — let loose a huge roar. After Clark‘s 3, Phelia missed a layup, for Michigan and Iowa’s Molly Davis rebounded. Iowa coach Lisa Bluder called timeout and a celebration ensued. Clark hugged teammates, Bluder and staffers, and the record was acknowledged while delighted fans continued to scream. “Just grateful. Thankful to be surrounded by people and be in a city that supports women’s basketball so much,” Clark said. “Be surrounded by my best friends and people that want to see me be great and push me to be great every single day.” Plum scored 57 points on the night she broke the scoring record in 2017 as a senior at Washington, and Clark played as if she had that on her mind. She had 23 points in the first quarter, making five of her first seven 3-pointers and 8 of 10 shots overall. Clark’s next target is the all-time major women’s college scoring record of 3,649 points by Kansas star Lynette Woodard from 1977-81. During Woodard’s era, women’s sports were governed by the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. Pearl Moore of Francis Marion holds the overall women’s record with 4,061 points from 1975-79. Iowa has four regular-season games left, plus the Big Ten Tournament and the NCAA Tournament. Barring injury, Clark, a senior who averages 32.1 points per game, is all but certain to pass Woodard. And she has the option to return for a fifth season of college basketball because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among those offering congratulations on social media was LSU star Angel Reese, who shared the spotlight with Clark in last season’s national championship game won by the Tigers. The Big Ten Network put out a congratulatory compilation video that included Tom Brady and Peyton and Eli Manning. Clark and her dynamic game have captivated the nation for two seasons. Last year, she led the Hawkeyes to the NCAA title game and was named AP player of the year. More than just her pursuit of the record, her long 3-pointers and flashy passes have raised interest in the women’s game to unprecedented levels. Arenas have been sold out for her games, home and away, and television ratings have never been higher. It’s all been more than Clark imagined when the 6-foot guard from West Des Moines stayed in state and picked Iowa over Notre Dame in November 2019. “I dreamed of doing really big things, playing in front of big crowds, going to the Final Four, maybe not quite on this level,” Clark said this week. “I think that’s really hard to dream. You can always exceed expectations, even your own, and I think that’s been one of the coolest parts.” Though her basketball obligations and endorsement deals (State Farm ads, etc.) have put demands on her time, she said she is the same person who showed up on campus four years ago. “I just go about my business as I did when I was a freshman during COVID,” Clark said. “Sure, my life has kind of changed somewhat. I still live the exact same way. I still act like a 22-year-old college kid.” She said she still cleans her apartment, does laundry, plays video games, hangs out with friends and does schoolwork. Her run to the record could have come earlier, but it arrived back at Carver-Hawkeye Arena, where ticket resale prices for the Michigan game ranged from hundreds of dollars into the thousands. Fans again showed up early outside the arena, many wearing black-and-gold No. 22 jerseys and holding signs paying homage. Mya Anderson and her friend, Ellie Steffensen, both 12, and their moms made the six-hour drive from Canton, South Dakota, to see Clark break the record. “I think she’s inspired a lot of people,” Mya said. “Yeah, a lot of little girls,” Ellie added. Mya and Ellie both play basketball, and both said they try to do some of the things Clark does on the court, like shoot long 3s. “But I’m not as good as her,” Ellie said. Kelly Jared of Manchester, Iowa, said she likes everything about Clark and expects her impact on the women’s game to endure. “She’s taken it to a new level,” Jared said. “The aspirations and goals that the current players and future players have, she has set that bar way up in the sky. And it’s perfect, because they will work to attain them. As as far as the fans, there’s excitement for the people who never watched women’s basketball. My son isn’t a basketball fan, but he watched Caitlin last year and he was sold. He absolutely loves her.” Unlike Sunday’s loss at Nebraska, which drew almost 2 million viewers on Fox, this game was streamed on Peacock. “I understand the magnitude of this,” Clark said. “It’s come along with how my four years have gone, and it’s crazy looking back on how fast everything has gone. I’m really thankful and grateful.”",

      "text": "(WSVN) - A South Florida teenager is fighting a traumatic injury, but he now has a new battle on his hands. 7’s Robbin Simmons has tonight’s 7 Investigates. Camille Harrison, Frederick Climpson’s mother: “We’ve told you all about his condition. Ma’am, he’s been traveling 42 miles for the last two months, OK?” A mom is fed up with a Miami-Dade County Transportation service after things went sour when her paralyzed son needed a ride. Camille Harrison: “It built up to a point where I was like, ‘OK, I’m done,’ because I’m frustrated.” Camille Harrison is doing all she can to get her son Frederick back to the energetic teenager he once was. Back in September, a helmet-to-helmet hit at a Homestead Senior High School football game left him severely injured. Frederick now needs a wheelchair. He relies on Miami-Dade County’s Special Transportation Service, or STS, to get him to his weekly physical therapy appointments. The service, funded by tax dollars, allows county residents with disabilities to ride for $3. Camille Harrison: “It’s a service that gets my son back and forth to his doctor’s appointments or anywhere he needs to go, if he needs to run errands or anything. The ride to rehab is more than 40 miles from Frederick’s Florida City home. Because of his spinal injury, he has to recline his chair throughout the day to keep his blood flowing, which means he has to ride in the front of the van to have enough space. Camille Harrison: “The dispatcher told us that if we want those type of accommodations for him, that we have to let them know ahead of time.” The family says they did call the county ahead of time. But things got heated on Feb. 6 when a driver put Frederick in the back. Camille Harrison: “I said, ‘No, no, he don’t go to the back. I had made special accommodations for him in his notes.’ He called dispatch, and then he told me, ‘Oh, they’re going to send somebody else.’ I said, ‘No, if they send somebody else, he won’t make it in time to his appointment.'” Camille recorded as her son was forced off the van. Camille Harrison: “‘Get off, get off, ma’am. Get off.’ I said, ‘No, I’m not going anywhere. Call the police,’ and they was like, ‘If police dispatch you, you can lose – you can lose the service.'” Frederick missed his appointment that day, and for the next three days, the van didn’t come to pick him up. The Miami-Dade Transit website says it is responsible for “resolving riders’ concerns.” But Camille says, after several calls to the county, nothing has been done. Camille Harrison: “They need to retrain their workers. They need to teach them compassion.” Frederick is now using a new transportation service paid through his insurance. But Camille hopes the county addresses problems like these because the transportation service is vital for so many. Camille Harrison: “My son, he was like, ‘This how I’m going to be treated?’ Like, he already had a traumatic injury.” Frederick has a long road ahead of him. He certainly didn’t need this transportation trouble. Robbin Simmons, 7News. The county told 7 Investigates that it does not have a record of Frederick’s family reaching out about his accommodation prior to the incident. They are reviewing what happened and say they will try to accommodate all reasonable requests from riders. The county released the following statement to 7News: We are aware of the incident involving Frederick Climpson and his mother on February 6, 2024, after requesting STS transportation services. We take all reports of service-related issues seriously and are committed to ensuring the safety and accessibility of our transportation services for all passengers, including those with special needs. Upon review of the incident, it has been determined that Frederick’s mother, the Primary Care Attendant (PCA), contacted the DTPW Paratransit call center on the day of the incident. Upon arrival of the STS vehicle at her home, Frederick’s mother expressed concerns regarding the seating arrangement for Frederick. According to her, he requires unique transportation accommodations due to his condition. Our staff provided guidance regarding the process for requesting reasonable accommodations and asked her to contact the DTPW ADA officer for further assistance.Unfortunately, during this interaction, there was some misunderstanding, and the situation escalated, leading to delays in service for other STS clients. We understand that passengers may sometimes require accommodations beyond our standard procedure, and while we strive to accommodate all reasonable requests, there are instances where requests fall outside what is permissible and can inadvertently impact our riders. We encourage passengers who require special accommodations to become familiar with the County’s STS guidelines and policies and to proactively communicate their needs to our call center, allowing us to better assist them. Additionally, DTPW is committed to working closely with our service contractor to continue providing the highest level of service and customer experience.We understand the frustration Frederick Climpson and his mother experienced and we regret any inconvenience caused. We remain dedicated to providing safe, reliable, and inclusive transportation services to all residents of Miami-Dade County. We will ensure that our team reviews this incident carefully to identify any areas for improvement and to prevent similar situations in the future.Calvin SykesMiami-Dade County Department of Transportation and Public Works CONTACT 7 INVESTIGATES:305-627-CLUE954-921-CLUE7Investigates@wsvn.com Copyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.
